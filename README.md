# Server Actions with tRPC

I've seen a lot of people confused about how to use tRPC with Server Actions. Made some examples to compare so you can get an idea of how you should (and shouldn't) use them.

Also, read [this great blog post by Sebastian](https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions), the Data Access Layer stuff is very relevant here (as tRPC makes a great data layer).
